## Contributing

If you want to contribute to the documentation, follow the steps below:
1. Fork the repository
2. Navigate to the `docs` directory
3. If you want to make a new category, create a directory with it's name, otherwise create a new file such as `<topic_name_here>.md` under the directory which is most appropriate for it.
    - You can fill this `.md` page with the content of the documentation you want to write.
4. Edit the `_sidebar.md` file and add a relative link to your new document, assuming that the `docs` folder is the root.<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup>

    - [<Name_for_documentation_page_you_wrote>](<location_of_.md>)
