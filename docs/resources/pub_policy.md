# PHA4GE Publication Policy

Public Health Alliance for Genomic Epidemiology (PHA4GE) aims to disseminate its outputs without unnecessary delay in order to facilitate an appropriate public health response.  The publications policy will guide this aim by clarifying the specific objectives and the processes to be followed.  Implementing and interpreting the policy is the primary responsibility of the PHA4GE Steering Committee. The publication policy is intended to promote fair and equitable attribution of credit in authorship among affiliations, investigators and funding organisations. In future, this authorship may be extended to acknowledging study participants especially where use cases exist to implement tools.
