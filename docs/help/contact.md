# Contact and Communication

If you need to get hold the PHA4GE members, the secretariat or working group chairs at PHA4GE then there are a few options for you.

## Slack

Slack is a platform that connects teams with the apps, services, and resources they need to get work done.

The main method for PHA4GE-wide communication is through using the Slack channel as it is significantly easier to keep track of than email chains.

Please contact [Jamie](mailto:jsouthgate@pha4ge.org) (jsouthgate_at_pha4ge.org) and ask to be added to the Slack channel.
